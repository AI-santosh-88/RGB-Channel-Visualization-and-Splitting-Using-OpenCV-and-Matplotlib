📌 Title:
RGB Channel Visualization and Splitting Using OpenCV and Matplotlib

📝 Description:
This  demonstrates how to load, process, and visualize an image using Python libraries such as OpenCV and Matplotlib. The primary goal is to decompose a color image into its individual RGB (Red, Green, Blue) channels and visualize each component to understand the role of color separation in digital image processing.


🎯 Responsibilities:

* Load and display an image using OpenCV in Google Colab.

* Understand the structure of an image as a 3D NumPy array.

* Split the image into individual color channels (R, G, B).

* Visualize each color channel separately using different color maps in Matplotlib.

* Understand the impact of each channel on the overall image composition.
  
  

📖 Key Concepts Demonstrated:

* Image matrices and RGB channels.

* Image processing using OpenCV.

* Visualization using Matplotlib colormaps.

* Working in a Colab environment for image analysis.
  
  

🧾 Summary:
This  is a hands-on introduction to digital image processing with Python. It allows learners or developers to explore how images are structured in matrices, how individual color channels contribute to the final image, and how to visualize and manipulate them. It serves as a foundational block for more advanced computer vision projects like filtering, segmentation, or object detection.
